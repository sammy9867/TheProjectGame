# The Project Game

The goal of The Project Game is to simulate a competitive project development environment where cooperation within the team is required, as well as competition with other teams. It is a board game where two teams compete against each other where the team who discovers their goals first wins. The structure of the game reinforces three notions:

* Every task carries a risk of failure.
* Goals of the project are not clear at start and they need to be discovered.
*  Cooperation between team members speeds up delivery of the project.

## Methodology & Technology used
* **Software Development Methodology** - Waterfall
* **Technology** - Java
* **Assignments of tasks** - Trello

The Waterfall approach will be used as our software development methodology. We will be using Trello to assign various tasks to team members.
