# The Project Game

The goal of The Project Game is to simulate a competitive project development environment where cooperation within the team is required, as well as competition with other teams. It is a board game where two teams compete against each other where the team who discovers their goals first wins. The structure of the game reinforces three notions:

* Every task carries a risk of failure.
* Goals of the project are not clear at start and they need to be discovered.
* Cooperation between team members speeds up delivery of the project.
